Hello Coder!
If you are just getting into your python learning journey, here is a list of curated easy-peezy codes to help you get started. Make sure to practise them a couple of times to familiarise yourself with the syntax and semantics, and also come up with your own way of solving the problem statement,because there's never always just one solution! Happy coding :)
